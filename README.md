# Employee-Management-System-CRUD-Application
INTERNSAVY INTERNSHIP

I have developed an Employee Management System using Java and the Swing framework as a part of my InternSavy internship. This application serves as a comprehensive solution for efficiently managing employee records within an organization. With its user-friendly interface, robust functionality, and seamless integration with MySQL, it provides seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations while maintaining data integrity.

Features
The Employee Management System offers the following key features:

Create: Users can easily add new employee records by entering relevant details such as name, contact information, job title, and department. This feature streamlines the process of onboarding new employees and ensures accurate data entry.

Read: The application provides a convenient and organized view of employee records in a tabular format. Users can easily browse through the records, accessing essential information about each employee, such as name, department, and job title.

Update: The system allows users to modify existing employee records as needed. They can update information such as contact details, job title, or department, ensuring that employee data remains up-to-date and accurate.

Delete: Users have the ability to remove employee records from the system when necessary. This feature simplifies the removal of outdated or redundant employee data, maintaining data cleanliness and integrity.

MySQL Integration: As a part of my InternSavy internship, I have integrated the Employee Management System with a MySQL database to store and manage employee records. This integration ensures data persistence, scalability, and robust data management capabilities.
